------------------------------- Change Log:
- 1.1.2:
  - FIXED: REAL bug that treated the mantissa as signed

- 1.1.1:
  - FIXED: REAL decoder bug that only took effect on very few numbers whose encoding
    yielded a "bit gap"

- 1.1.0:
  - NOTE: this version introduces code-breaking changes!
  - EmberLib: removed parameter "encodable" from EmberNode.BuildTree,
    removed protected and internal constructors from entire dom tree.
    All dom objects are now lazily encodable.
    This is a code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib: moved all methods primarily used for legacy purposes (Ember1)
    to a new assembly (targeting .net 3.5) called "EmberLib.Legacy.Extensions".
    This assembly defines extension methods for the multitude of "Get" and
    "Insert" overloads previously found in the class EmberLib.EmberNode.
    This is a code-breaking change for projects using Ember v1.
  - EmberLib: Added the index operator to EmberLib.EmberNode, which supersedes
    the "Get" and "GetChildNode" methods.
  - EmberLib: removed method EmberNode.Unchain since it basically is identical
    to EmberNode.Remove.
    This is a possibly code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib: moved method CreateApplicationDefinedSet from EmberSet to
    EmberApplicationInterface
    This is a possibly code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib: moved method CreateApplicationDefinedSequence from EmberSequence to
    EmberApplicationInterface
    This is a possibly code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib: Added the DecoderValidation class. This class can be used by classes
    derived from EmberNode to raise validation error events after being decoded.
  - EmberLib: added static method "CreateOrderedSequence" to EmberSequence, which
    creates a sequence whose children are encoded ordered by tag.
  - EmberLib: Refactored EmberNode to better match libember::dom::Node:
    - Renamed method "Write" to "Encode"
    - Renamed method "BuildTree" to "Decode"
    - Internalized property "Length" and renamed to "EncodedLength"
    - Removed property "IsContainer". Change "if(node.IsContainer)" to
      "if(node is EmberContainer)".
    - Removed property "HasIndefiniteLength". The Ember DOM now only uses
      the definite length form.
    - Removed protected property "EncodedHeader".
    This is a possibly code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib: Internalized or sealed many overridables which were of no use
    outside of the library.
    This is a possibly code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib: FIXED: RelativeOid encoding was limited to maximum length of 127 bytes.
  - EmberLib.Framing: added parameter "keepAliveCallback" to constructor
    of FramingReader and events "KeepAliveRequestReceived" and
    "KeepAliveResponseReceived" to FramingReader.
    These events supersede usage of the PackageReceived event.
    This is a code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib.Glow: Enabled setting parameter content properties
    and node content properties more often than once.
  - EmberLib.Glow: Changed behavior of property "EffectiveParameterType"
    of type GlowParameterBase to pay attention to the "Trigger" type.
  - EmberLib.Glow: added parameter "keepAliveCallback" to constructor
    of EmberLib.Glow.Framing.GlowReader.
    This is a code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib.Glow: removed parameter "isEncodable" from
    EmberLib.Glow.Framing.GlowReader constructor.
    This is a code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib.Glow: GlowParameterBase and GlowNodeBase validate the identifier
    in the setter of property "Identifier" and after being decoded (using
    the new EmberLib.DecoderValidation class).
  - EmberLib.Glow: added support for "isOnline" field of EmberPlus-Glow.NodeContents
  - EmberLib.Glow: added class "GlowWalker' which implements the IGlowVisitor interface.
    This class provides an easier way to walk a Glow tree by making iterations over
    element collections transparent. It also removes the need to differentiate between
    element types and their qualified counterparts (e.g. Parameter and QualifiedParameter).
    See EmberPlusRegistryProvider for an example.
  - EmberLib.Glow: Internalized or sealed many overridables which were of no use
    outside of the library.
    This is a possibly code-breaking change.
  - EmberLib.Glow: FIXED: StreamDescription type was decoded
    with wrong type (StreamCollection instead of StreamDescription)
  - EmberLib.Glow.Formulas: Added functions abs and sgn
  - Added new project/assembly "EmberLib.Glow.PowerPack", which provides tools
    for parameter value conversion.
  - Released as source code under LGPL. No more binary releases are planned.
    The source codes uses C# 4 and F# 2, but targets .net framework 2.0.
    The solution and projects are in VS2010 format.

- 1.0.13:
  - EmberLib.Framing: Added restrictions for maximum package length.
  - EmberLib.Glow: Added a new constructor to EmberLib.Glow.Framing.GlowOutput
    with the default (maximum) package length.
  - EmberLib.Glow.Formulas: added parameter "emitIlFlag" to Compiler.Compile().
    This flag tells the compiler to emit the formula as IL code, which results
    in a huge speedup for formula evaluation.
  - EmberLib: Replaced property EmberLib.EmberNode.HasChildren with property
    Count.

- 1.0.12:
  - FIXED: EmberLib.Framing: wrong position of "flags" byte in S101 frame.

- 1.0.11:
  - Implements Glow DTD 2.5
  - EmberEncoding v1.6:
    - Fixed RelativeOid encoding to adhere to the standard:
      It now encodes an array of integers instead of an ulong value.
  - Renamed "RelativeObject..." to "RelativeOid..." (e.g. RelativeObjectLeaf)
  - Added constants for glow command numbers:
    EmberLib.Glow.GlowCommands.Dir, EmberLib.Glow.GlowCommands.Subscribe etc.
  - Renamed "EmberLib.Glow.GlowCommands" to "GlowCommandType" for better
    alignment with libember.
  - Added property "EffectiveParameterType" to EmberLib.Glow.GlowParameter.
  - Added type: EmberLib.Glow.GlowParameterType.
  - Added type: EmberLib.Glow.GlowAccess.
  - Internalized property EmberLib.Glow.GlowParameter.Formula.
  - Added Methods EmberLib.Glow.GlowParameter.GetFormula() and
    EmberLib.Glow.GlowParameter.SetFormula().
  - Added type: EmberLib.Glow.GlowFormulaSource
  - Added assembly "EmberLib.Glow.Formula", which includes a formula compiler.
  - Added static methods WriteKeepAliveRequest and WriteKeepAliveRequest to
    EmberLib.Framing.BerFramingOutput.
  - Implements new framing parameters.

- 1.0.10:
  - Implements Glow DTD 2.4
  - EmberLib.Framing.FramingBerOutput.MaximumPackageLength now
    includes length of header.


------------------------------- Requirements:
- .net framework 2.0 / mono 2.6 or higher
- C# 4.0 Compiler
- Only for EmberLib.Glow.Formula:
  - F# 2.0 Runtime
    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13450
  - F# PowerPack
    http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/releases/view/45593
  - F# 2.0 Compiler


------------------------------- Description:
EmberLib.net is an implementation of the Ember+ standard for the .net framework.
The component version numbers are defined in the following constants:

EmberLib.Glow.GlowDtd.Version
   the version of the glow DTD supported by the library

EmberLib.EmberEncoding.Version
   the version of the ember encoding supported by the libary

Assembly Version of any included assembly
   the version of the library implementation

EmberLib.net provides classes to convert ember data to XML and back - see
EmberLib.Xml.Export and EmberLib.Xml.Import.
This may be very useful for debugging.


------------------------------- Using the Library:
-  Unpack the zip file to any directory
-  In your project, add references to the files "BerLib.dll",
   "EmberLib.dll", "EmberLib.Framing.dll" and "EmberLib.Glow.dll".


------------------------------- Getting Started with the Code:

-  Build the sample project "EmberPlusWalk.net" (which is actually a .net 4 /
   mono 2.10 application).
-  EmberPlusWalk.net is a small console shell allowing you to navigate through
   the glow tree provided by any Ember+ provider (e.g. TinyEmberPlus).
-  Type "help" in the GlowWalk.net shell to see a list of supported commands.
-  Have a look at "GlowEndPoint.cs" to learn how to set up an
   EmberLib.Glow.Framing.GlowReader instance for reading and an
   EmberLib.Glow.Framing.GlowOutput instance for writing.
-  Have a look at "Model.cs" to learn how to build glow trees ready for
   dispatch and how to read glow data into the local object model.
-  All public methods and properties in EmberLib.net have XML doc comments.
