------------------------------- Change Log:
- 1.40:
  - FIXED: glow tag for EmberPlus-Glow.MatrixContents.labels was wrong
  - adjusted version number to match scheme proposed by kimohoff

- 1.20:
  - Implements Glow DTD 2.20 (function extensions)
  - split files "emberglow.h" and "emberglow.c"
    into "glow.h", "glowtx.h", "glowrx.h", "glow.c",
    "glowtx.c" and "glowrx.c".

- 1.12:
  - FIXED: REAL bug that treated the mantissa as signed

- 1.11:
  - FIXED: REAL decoder bug that only took effect on very few numbers whose
    encoding yielded a "bit gap"

- 1.10:
  - Implements Glow DTD 2.10 (matrix extensions)
  - Added top header "emberplus.h"
  - Moved define EMBER_LIBRARY_VERSION from ember.h to emberplus.h
  - Moved prototype for ember_init to from ember.h to emberplus.h
    to enforce usage of new top header.
  - Validates identifiers when writing and after decoding.
  - The "onNode" callback type (used by GlowReader) has changed: it now
    receives the "fields" parameter as defined by the "onParameter" callback.
  - Added support for "isOnline" field of EmberPlus-Glow.NodeContents.
  - Removed reliance on fixed-size buffers. ember_init now has two
    additional parameters: allocMemory and freeMemory.
    The passed callbacks are used to allocate memory dynamically.
    Therefore, you no longer need to initialize a GlowReader with
    a dedicated value buffer.
    The following members have been changed from buffers to pointers:
    - GlowParameter.identifier -> pIdentifier
    - GlowParameter.description -> pDescription
    - GlowOctetsValue.octets -> pOctets
    - GlowNode.identifier -> pIdentifier
    - GlowNode.description -> pDescription
    - GlowValue.string -> pString
  - Added free() functions for each type that contains pointers:
    - glowParameter_free
    - glowNode_free
    - glowValue_free
    The application does not need to call these functions on the RX side
    (since the GlowReader calls them), only on the TX side.
  - Removed defines GLOW_MAX_VALUE_LENGTH, GLOW_MAX_IDENTIFIER_LENGTH and
    GLOW_MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH.
  - FIXED: RELATIVE-OID encoding was limited to a length of 16 bytes.

- 1.5:
  - Put under LGPL
  - Implemented fragmented packages on TX side:
    see glowOutput_beginPackage and glowOutput_beginPackage.
    NOTE: This is a breaking change!
  - Replaced function glow_writeStreamEntries with glow_writeStreamEntry.
    NOTE: This is a breaking change!
  - FIXED: when the "type" field of a received parameter was present, the
    "isOnline" field was marked as present instead.
  - Removed some unused code
  - Renamed sample file "__sample_glowwalk.c" to "__sample_consumer.c".

- 1.4:
  - glow_writeQualifiedCommand now supports the "dirFieldMask" field.
  - ParameterContents.streamDescriptor field now supported on RX side.

- 1.3:
  - FIXED: After setting a parameter value using the QualifiedParameter type
    and then issuing a GetDirectory command on a parameter, the onParameter
    callback was called with a wrong "fields" mask.
  - FIXED: glow_writeQualifiedCommand did not work for a command at the root
    level.
  - FIXED: After receiving a nested parameter, pathLength was reported wrong
    for all following elements on the same level as the parameter.
  - FIXED: Problems with reading QualifiedNode objects.
  - Fixed some gcc specific warnings.
  - Included new consumer sample (__sample_glowwalk.c").

- 1.2:
  - Support for Glow DTD 2.5
  - glow_writeStreamEntries uses a GlowStreamCollection as root instead
    of a GlowRootElementCollection nesting a GlowStreamCollection.
  - glow_writeNodeWithPath etc. renamed to glow_writeQualifiedNode
    with subtle changes in interpretation of the "pPath" argument.
  - Always uses the new glow types "QualifiedParameter" and "QualifiedNode"
    on the TX side.
  - EmberEncoding v1.6:
    - Fixed RelativeOid encoding to comply to the standard:
      It now encodes an array of integers instead of an ulonglong value.
  - Renamed "RelativeObject..." to "RelativeOid..."
    (e.g. ber_encodeRelativeObject)
  - Streamlined naming of preprocessor defines:
    - _INCLUDE_BER_CUSTOM_H renamed to INCLUDE_BERCUSTOM_H
    - _SECURE_CRT renamed to SECURE_CRT
    - _EMBER_MAX_TREE_DEPTH renamed to EMBER_MAX_TREE_DEPTH
    - EMBER_EncodingVersion renamed to EMBER_ENCODING_VERSION
    - EMBER_LibraryVersion renamed to EMBER_LIBRARY_VERSION
    - GLOW_DtdVersion renamed to GLOW_SCHEMA_VERSION
  - Replaced defines for glow command numbers with enum GlowCommandType.
  - Streamlined enum naming:
    - Renamed GlowParameterFields to GlowFieldFlags
    - Renamed GlowParameterField entries to begin with GlowFieldFlag_
      instead of ParamField_.
  - Removed RX support for the Parameter.format field.
  - Added new callback to NonFramingGlowReader: onUnsupportedTltlv.
    If set, this callback is invoked whenever the reader encounters a
    TLTLV it does not support out-of-the-box. E.g. this callback is
    invoked for the Parameter fields "enumeration", "formula" and "format".
  - Added new callback to GlowReader: onPackageReceived.
    If set, this callback is invoked whenever a valid framing package
    has been unframed.
  - Added functions emberFraming_writeKeepAliveRequest and
    emberFraming_writeKeepAliveResponse.

- 1.1:
  - Support for ppm stream subscriptions
  - Removed inline variable declarations since some gcc
    implementations (e.g. avr-gcc) seem to have problems
    with those.
  - Added defines for glow command numbers to emberglow.h:
    GLOW_CommandDir, GLOW_CommandSubscribe etc.

- 1.0:
  - Top-level support for ppm streams
  - Compiles and runs on ARM7 cpu board with ethernut os.

- 0.10:
  - Support for Glow DTD 2.4

- 0.9:
  - beta release


------------------------------- Requirements:
- ANSI C runtime
- only for sample "__sample_program.c": Win32 Sockets API (Winsock2)


------------------------------- Description:
libember_slim is a light-weight library written in ANSI C, covering the
Ember+ standard.
The component version numbers are defined in the library's header files:

GLOW_SCHEMA_VERSION
   the version of the glow schema ("DTD") supported by the library

EMBER_ENCODING_VERSION
   the version of the ember encoding supported by the libary

EMBER_LIBRARY_VERSION
   the version of the library implementation

libember_slim differs from libember in the following ways:
-  programming language: libember_slim is written in plain ANSI C whereas
   libember is written in C++ 3.
-  object model: libember_slim does not define classes that make up
   a DOM (like libember::dom::node in libember). Instead of building
   an in-memory ember tree using the DOM classes and then encoding
   the tree for transport, libember_slim directly encodes information
   in memory for transport.
   therefore, libember_slim has a much smaller memory footprint than libember
   and exposes a procedural interface instead of an object-oriented one.
-  ember encoding: libember_slim uses the indefinite length form when encoding
   ember containers. This means that containers are not length-prefixed but
   suffixed with a container terminator.
   all implementations of the ember/glow standard are required to handle
   both length forms when decoding.


------------------------------- Known Issues:
-  Glow: Parameter.enumMap is not supported
-  Glow: Parameter.defaultValue is not supported
-  Glow: Parameter.enumeration is supported for TX only.
-  Glow: Parameter.formula is supported for TX only.
-  Glow: Parameter.format is supported for TX only.
-  Glow: Matrix.labels is not supported.


------------------------------- Using the Library:
-  copy all code files and header files (except the sample "__sample_program.c")
   to your project and include the C files in the makefile/project file.
-  supported preprocessor defines (to be set in makefile):
   -  _DEBUG
      if defined, debugging checks (ASSERTs) are enabled.
   -  SECURE_CRT
      if defined, secure versions of the C runtime calls from stdio.h
      and string.h are used (e.g. strcpy_s instead of strcpy).
      only define when building against a runtime that implements these
      calls (e.g. MSVCRT).
   -  INCLUDE_BERCUSTOM_H
      if defined, a header file called "bercustom.h" is included first
      in bertypes.h. In this header you can adjust standard typedefs to the
      target platform. The standard typedefs used by libember_slim can be
      found in bertypes.h.
   -  EMBER_MAX_TREE_DEPTH=<value>
      defines the maximum depth of a decodable ember tree.
      default is 65.
-  When using the library in a C++ environment, make sure you tell
   the compiler to compile the library as C++ - this forces use of
   the native C++ bool type instead of the typedef from "bertypes.h".
-  If the type bool is already defined in another location of your project,
   make sure you adjust the typedef used by libember_slim (using bercustom.h),
   so that both definitions of the bool type have the same sizeof.


------------------------------- Getting Started with the Code:

-  include "emberplus.h" in your implementation file.
-  call "ember_init(throwError_t, failAssertion_t)" in your entry-point
   function to configure error reporting.
-  NOTE: all functions and types are documented (doxygen-style) in the
   header files.
-  set up an instance of type GlowReader in the code where you receive
   ember data. Initialize the instance with a call to "glowReader_init(...)".
-  call "glowReader_readBytes(...)" to feed received bytes into the reader.
-  set up an instance of type GlowOutput in the code where you send ember
   data. Initialize the instance with a call to "glowOutput_init(...)".
-  call any of the "glow_write..." functions to write ember encoded glow
   data to the output. Afterwards, the encoded data will be contained ready
   to be sent in the buffer passed to the GlowOutput.
-  it is probably easiest to port the sample "__sample_program.c" to your application
   as a start.
